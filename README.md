passhash
========

Javascript password hasher &amp; manager.

Eventually this will be more modular, but right now, it's all 
one page while I tinker with it.

TODO:

One JS file with configuration, loaded at start.
One JS file with all management funcs.
Separate CSS file.

Config dicates hashing functions used, number of bits stored, 
and default output size.

Make it into an "app" that works on my stupid phone.
